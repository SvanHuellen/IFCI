An ealier version of this code has been used to produce results reported in the following paper:
Qin, Duo, Sophie van Huellen, Qing Chao Wang, and Thanos Moraitis. 2018. Algorithmic Modelling of Financial Conditions for Macro Predictive Purposes: Pilot Application on the USA. SOAS Department of Economics Working Paper Series No 201 - 2016 , Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3264627
Please see the paper for more information on the project and the data used. 

The current version, with the addition of the grouping algorithm has been used to produce results reported in the following paper:
van Huellen, Sophie, Duo Qin, Shan Lu, Huiwen Wang, Qing Chao Wang, and Thanos Moraitis. 2020. Modelling Opportunity Cost Effects in Money Demanddue to Openness. International Journal of Finance & Economics, 1-48.https://doi.org/10.1002/ijfe.2175

The grouping algorithm has been written by Dr Shan Lu (CUFE, Beijing, China). 
The IFCI algorithm (header and implementation) has been written by Dr Ho Tak Yui (LSE, London, UK) in collaboration with Qingchao Wang (SOAS, London, UK).
The R documentation has been written by Dr Ho Tak Yui (LSE, London, UK).
