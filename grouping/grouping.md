Code to find groups if desired.

The output includes:

(1)	Grouping results in txt, which can be further manually developed into excel to feed the group_average.R program.

(2)	Figures of each group.

To average the grouped indicators, one can use the code file : group_average.R.
The input data should be formatted as groups_results_summary.xlsx. This program will give you grouped series by markets.
